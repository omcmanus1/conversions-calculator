# Go Backend

A basic Go server with endpoints to calculate conversions from US measurements to metric format (recipes, heights etc.). Runs using a local server in development mode, and cloud functions in production.

## TODO

- Simplify Logic
  - Automatically return most appropriate units based on amount (e.g. 1.5l vs 1500ml) if no OutputUnit is provided?
- New Features
  - ~~Add height conversion endpoints~~
