# Recipe Measurements Converter - Go Backend

A basic Golang app to translate US recipe measurements into UK formats. Mainly aiming to get used to Golang syntax & concepts

## TODO

- Automatically return most appropriate units based on amount (e.g. 1.5l vs 1500ml)
  - If no OutputUnit is provided?
- Update Flow function to accept array of Setup structs for full ingredient list
- Add tests
- Create server endpoint for potential frontend usage
  - Return JSON
- Build frontend calculator?
